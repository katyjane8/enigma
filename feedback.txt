Feedback (include appreciation and coaching; make it specific, actionable, and kind):
Katy you rock! I had a great time working on our project with you. I liked that you showed appreciation through-out the project, and your fun personality made it a blast to work with you. I loved that we were able to make time to go out and get food on multiple occasions and still keep our progress forward moving. I can not say enough how awesome it was to work with you, the communication was great and because of that we were able to have lots of time for meeting in person to work on our project. I appreciate your observation of fatigue whenever I was driving and offering to switch I try to pay attention to that in my future partners.

I am sad we were not able to finish our project, I feel something that we could have done to improve on this was make better use of our time when we got stuck on something possibly reaching out to a higher mod (in-person, slack, or screen hero) to help us get out of a sticky situation. If I could do it all over again I would present the idea of making a project road-map so we had a clearer idea of how we wanted our project to end up, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing you are awesome! Thanks for staying after hours so late to keep our project pushing forward, I really appreciate the sacrifices you made to do this.
